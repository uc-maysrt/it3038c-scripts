### Lab 9 files
apistart.py is the practice from the word document
widgets.json is the downloaded file (just easier to have it in the same directory)
lab9-api.js is the node js file from the word document/lab assignment
lab9-api.py is the python file for the lab to pull from the node js file.  It outputs to the console for the results.
