# Project 1
This program bulk creates and moves files based on user input.  I created it because I have a large amount of files that I would like to be more organized based on the numeric sequence they are in.
To run this program, make sure Python3 is installed and working.

If using Windows, type:
python --version

If using Linux, you may need to specify Python3:
python3 --version


From the project1 folder that contains bulkfilemover.py, run the program using Python
python bulkfilemover.py

Example Output:
```$python bulkfilemover.py
